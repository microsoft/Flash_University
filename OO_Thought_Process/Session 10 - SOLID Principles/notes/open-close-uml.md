# Open/Close Principle Examples

The Open/Close Principle states that "a class should be open for extension, and 
closed for modification".

You should be able to extend a classâ€™s behavior, without modifying it.

## Without OCP

In this example, we have a class that calculates the area of rectangles.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Rectangle {
        double length
        double width
    }

    class CalculateAreas {
        -double area

        +CalcArea(Rectangle) double
    }

    Rectangle <.. CalculateAreas
```

**Issues:** the `CalculateAreas` class only handles rectancles, if we wanted
to add another shape we'd have to modify the existing behavior.

## With OCP

Instead we should extend our code via subclasses, that way the original classes
don't need to be changed

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Shape {
        <<abstract>>
        +GetArea()* double
    }

    Shape <|-- Rectangle
    class Rectangle {
        -double length
        -double width
        +GetArea() double
    }

    Shape <|-- Circle
    class Circle {
        -double radius
        +GetArea() double
    }

    Shape <.. CalculateAreas
    class CalculateAreas {
        +CalcArea(Shape) double
    }
```
