# Design Patterns

The folder contains the notes and examples for all of the Design Patterns
that we'll go through in the CY22Q3 University of Flash course.

We will use the classic GoF Design Patterns book as the primary resource.
It is available online through the MS Library or on O'Reilly ([here](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/))
