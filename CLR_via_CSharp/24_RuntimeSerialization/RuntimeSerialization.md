# Runtime Serialization

## Goals

## Why is Serialization useful
- at the end of the day, everything gets stored in bytes
- so the ability to convert something to and fro bytes is at the core of what computers do
- Say we copy an item and use it in a different app, how does that work?
- what types of serialization do you think exist?


# Lets make something serializable
- take a type
- add the flag
- what does ignore do?
- Does order matter?
## Mike's notes

- default behavior
- tagging
- do name and order matter
- enums as problems
- good practice of adding enums to the end
- json vs xml
- why do we use newton soft
- What it might look like (see link)
