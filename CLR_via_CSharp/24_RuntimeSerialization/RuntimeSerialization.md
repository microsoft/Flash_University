# Runtime Serialization

## Goals

## Why is Serialization useful
- at the end of the day, everything gets stored in bytes
- so the ability to convert something to and fro bytes is at the core of what computers do
- Say we copy an item and use it in a different app, how does that work?
- what types of serialization do you think exist?
