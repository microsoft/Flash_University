Console.WriteLine("Welcome to Week 3; This week we're going to go over chapter 5");
Console.WriteLine("Here are a couple of review questions");
Console.WriteLine("1. What is a type");
//basic building block inside of the CLR; 
Console.WriteLine("2. What is the difference between a Compile time and RunTime Exception");
//compile time has problems even before the program runs on the CLR; run time has problems when code is on the CLR --> classic case is forcing a type into its parent class
Console.WriteLine("3. What does it mean to be type safe");
//Every class knows it's exact type/there is only one type for a class/guaranteed behavior

Console.WriteLine("This weeks order will be primitive types --> reference/value types --> boxing --> hashcodes and dynaic if we have time");

//TODO.Srikar Boxing and Dynamic
