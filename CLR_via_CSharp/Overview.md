# CLR via C# Overview
## Srikar Mylavarapu
---
## Long Term Goals
- Have fun
- Focus on retention and "why"
- 1-2 chapters per session
---
## Materials covered
- Book is really long and really dense
- There is no feasible way for me to get through all of it
- rationale for skips at bottom of this doc
- Expect about 1-2 chapters a week depending on difficulty of chapters, generalized notes/ideas for that week from me on the repo, and code examples/problems we can work through.
- Ideally, the only place you should have to check is the public FLASH_University Repo in github.com/microsoft/FLASH_University/CLR_Via_CSharp
---
## My Goals
- Make it useful

## Philosophy
- There are no stupid questions.
- I hate powerpoints. Especially outlines translated into powerpoints. But they have their use.
---

## Expectations
- If you want to make the most of it, a copy of the book (available as an ebook via oreilly or physical) is probably a good idea (It is the source of truth)
- Have fun, let me know if things are working/not working
    - I am beginner (was a chemist [not sure how long I can keep using that])
    - I will make mistakes, feel free to correct me/ask questions at just about any time
---

## Expected Schedule/topics (completely tentative)
### Week 1
- Chapter 1: CLR Execution model + some background history
- Basic structure of an application

### Week 2
- Chapters 4, 5

---

#### Srikar's Opinions on why certain things are skipped:
- Chapter 2,3 
    - A little more advanced/not as hands on for teaching a "C# course"
- Chapter 5 
    - boxing and unboxing 
    - dynamic primitive types
        I Want to get back to these, I think i'm ready to get this one this time around
- Chapter 8 
    - missed type constructors on 187
- Chapter 17
    - Delegate Chaining
        - wanted a simpler chapter after a while (want to make a pass through again)
