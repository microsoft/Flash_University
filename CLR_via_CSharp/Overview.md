# Overview

## Long Term Goals
### Material covered
- Book is really long and really dense
- There is no feasible way for me to get through all of it
- Focus on the C# and understanding parts
- Expect about 1 chapter a week, generalized notes/ideas for that week from me on the repo, and code examples/problems we can work through.
- Ideally, the only place you should have to check is the public FLASH_University Repo in github.com/microsoft/FLASH_University
### My Goal
- I hope at the end of it, everyone says that they found it useful, found it to become better  over time, and would recommend it to someone else.
### Expectations
- probably irrational to expect anyone to study before coming to class
- Assuming people don't know much/anything 
- If you want to make the most of it, a copy of the book (available as an ebook via oreilly or physical) is probably a good idea
- Have fun, let me know if things are working/not working
    - I am beginner (was a chemist [not sure how long I can keep using that])
    - I will make mistakes, feel free to correct me/ask questions at just about any time
- I hate powerpoints. Especially outlines translated into powerpoints.
- I'm going to try to have as much stuff be tactile/on your computer. 
- Ideally, you can just follow the presentation via md and the code samples.
- Even better would be if I just talked, one of you shared your screen and we worked off one of your computers.
