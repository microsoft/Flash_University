# Overview

## Long Term Goals
### Material covered
- Book is really long and really dense
- There is no feasible way for me to get through all of it
    - I promise to give rationale on this doc why certain things are skipped/lightly covered
- Focus on the C# understanding how things work
- Expect about 1-2 chapters a week depending on difficulty of chapters, generalized notes/ideas for that week from me on the repo, and code examples/problems we can work through.
- Ideally, the only place you should have to check is the public FLASH_University Repo in github.com/microsoft/FLASH_University/CLR_Via_CSharp
### My Goal
- I hope at the end of it, everyone says that they found it useful, found it to become better  over time, and would recommend it to someone else.
- I'm going to try to have as much stuff be tactile/on your computer. 
- Ideally, you can just follow the presentation via md and the code samples.
- Even better would be if I just talked, one of you shared your screen and we worked off one of your computers.

### Philosophy
- The most important thing is retention and ability to use material.
- most people here would not be here if they couldn't pass the coding questions
- There are no stupid questions.
- I hate powerpoints. Especially outlines translated into powerpoints. But they have their use.

### Expectations
- Probably irrational to expect everyone to study/read chapter/ before coming to class
- If you want to make the most of it, a copy of the book (available as an ebook via oreilly or physical) is probably a good idea
- Have fun, let me know if things are working/not working
    - I am beginner (was a chemist [not sure how long I can keep using that])
    - I will make mistakes, feel free to correct me/ask questions at just about any time

## Expected Schedule/topics (completely tentative)
### Week 1
- Chapter 1: CLR Execution model + some background history
- Basic structure of an application

### Week 2
- Chapters 4, 5



Srikar's Opinions on why certain things are skipped:
- Chapter 2,3 
    - A little more advanced/not as hands on for teaching a "C# course"
